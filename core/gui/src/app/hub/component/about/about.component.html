    <h2 class = "jail-title">Jail Hub Description</h2>
    <p>
      Jail incarceration is a specific area of criminal legal policy and practice that is especially opaque and often
      overlooked in studies of U.S. incarceration due to data limitations. This platform is designed to
      increase data transparency, replication, and new research around the consequences of U.S. jail incarceration
      for health, wellbeing, and safety. Specifically, it facilitates open access to data
      and analytic pipelines, enables archiving and analysis of investigator-initiated projects, and brings
      together a community of criminal legal researchers dedicated to data transparency, replication, and integration
      across projects that would otherwise be conducted and archived in isolation. This project is led by
      Naomi Sugie (Sociology, UCLA), Kristin Turney (Sociology, UC Irvine), and Chen Li (Computer Science, UC Irvine).
